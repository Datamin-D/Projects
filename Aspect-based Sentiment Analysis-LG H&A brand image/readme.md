# Brand Image Analysis on Global Home Applizance Company
## The project aims to analyze brand image of Home Appliances company using user review data including Twitter, Amazon review, Blog and so on.
## This project was a team project. I only uploaded the codes that i implemented myself.
## Code related to sales information is deleted to avoid legal issues. (Analysis on how the aspect impact on sales was conducted but not uploaded.)
## PPT on our project is not uploaded since the company wants this information is classified as confidential.

# This is the process of our project.
